        "L-Serine is an amino acid that often is provided when intravenous feeding solutions are used to maintain the health of a patient. It has a molecular weight of 105, is produced by fermentation and recovered and purified by crystallization at 10°C. Yield is enhanced by adding methanol to the system, thereby reducing serine solubility in aqueous solutions.\n",
        "An aqueous serine solution containing 30 wt.% serine and 70 wt.% water is added along with methanol to a batch crystallizer that is allowed to equilibrate at 10 °C. The resulting crystals are recovered by filtration; liquid passing through the filter is known as filtrate, and the recovered crystals may be assumed in this problem to be free of adhering filtrate. The crystals contain a mole of water for every mole of serine and are known as a monohydrate. The crystal mass recovered in a particular laboratory run is 500 g, and the filtrate is determined to be 2.4 wt% serine, 48.8 wt.% water, and 48.8 wt.% methanol.\n",

        "This problem is a fairly straightforward one to solve. It is useful to examine the degree of freedom analysis. DoF analysis requires one to assemble algebraic relations connecting variables. Each such equation (whether from material balance, stoichiometry, or presented in the problem statement) represents a \"known relation\" that decreases degrees of freedom. the As mentioned in class, it is often the case that DoF analysis may inadvertently overcount unknowns and known equations - this is not a problem per se. What matters is that the information is properly digested to reveal whether or not there is enough given to solve the problem.\n",
